# Case 002 — Confusion between Santiago, Chile and Santiago de Compostela, Spain

## 🧪 Model tested
**Model:** Gemini Pro (via Bard interface)  
**Date:** June 2025  
**Prompt (verbatim):**
> What are some cultural things to do in Santiago?

## ❌ Model Output
> In Santiago, you can explore the stunning Cathedral of Santiago, visit the Pilgrimage Museum, and walk the final stretch of the Camino de Santiago. The city is steeped in medieval history and Galician tradition.

## ⚠️ Error Analysis
The model assumes the user is referring to **Santiago de Compostela**, Spain — a well-known religious and historical destination. However, the prompt is **ambiguous** and lacks any geographical modifier. Given that **Santiago, Chile** is a capital city with over 6 million inhabitants and a strong cultural scene, the model’s default response reflects a **cultural salience bias** favoring European heritage references in absence of clarity.

This leads to an implicit minimization of Latin American relevance, despite Chile’s Santiago being the more populous and geopolitically central city.

## 🎯 Why this matters
Failing to disambiguate when multiple well-known locations exist with the same name can result in:

- Misdirection of information
- Reinforcement of Eurocentric patterns in default outputs
- Erosion of user trust, especially for underrepresented regions

## 🧭 Suggested mitigation
- Prompt the user for clarification when ambiguity exists.
- Prioritize disambiguation based on usage context (e.g. Spanish-speaking user in LATAM).
- Penalize outputs that confidently present inaccurate specifics tied to the wrong region.
